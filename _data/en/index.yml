  introduction: >
    Caracteres is a collection of pages about interesting letters, symbols, ligatures,
    etc. present in languages that share the Roman alphabet.


    The name "caracteres" comes from the Spanish translation of "characters".
    According to the
    [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/character), "character" means:

      - one of the attributes or features that make up and distinguish an individual
      - a graphic symbol used in writing or printing


    We love the idea that letters and symbols contribute to the personality of a language
    and influence their speakers.
