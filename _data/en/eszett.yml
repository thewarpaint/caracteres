description: The Eszett is a letter of the German language.

explanationItems:
  - >
    The <b>Eszett</b> (IPA: <span class="ipa">[ɛsˈtsɛt]</span>) is a German letter used to represent the
    <b>[s]</b> phoneme when used after long vowels and diphthongs.
  - >
    Its name comes from the pronunciation of the letters <b>s (es)</b> and <b>z (zett)</b>.
  - >
    It originated as a ligature for <b>long s and tailed z</b> <span class="ipa">ſʒ</span> and
    <b>long s and round s</b> <span class="ipa">ſs</span>.

    The <b>uppercase form ẞ</b> introduced by type designers during the early 20th century only gained
    official recognition until 2017. The Eszett is still commonly replaced with <b>SS</b> when capital
    letters are used.
