    The <b>cê-cedilha</b> is a variant of the letter C used in the Portuguese language.
  - >
    It represents the <b>soft S sound</b> (<span class="ipa">/s/</span>) when the letter C is placed
    <b>before A</b>, <b>O</b> or <b>U</b>.
  - >
    It has a similar behaviour in other Romance languages like <b>Catalan</b>, <b>French</b> and
    <b>Occitan</b>. It is also present in <b>English</b>, used in <b>loanwords such as façade</b>.
  - >
    In modern Portuguese <b>it is never located at the beginning or the end of a word</b>, in that case
    the letter S is used instead.
