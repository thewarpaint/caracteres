description: The cê-cedilha is a variant of the letter C used in the Portuguese language.

explanationItems:
  - >
    The <a class="link link--listenable">cê-cedilha</a> is a variant of the letter C used
    in the Portuguese language.
  - >
    It represents the soft S sound (<span class="ipa">/s/</span>) when the letter C is placed
    before A, O or U.
  - >
    It has a similar behaviour in other Romance languages like Catalan, French and
    Occitan. It is also present in English, used in loanwords such as
    <a class="link link--listenable">façade</a>.
  - >
    In modern Portuguese it is never located at the beginning or the end of a word, in that case
    the letter S is used instead.
