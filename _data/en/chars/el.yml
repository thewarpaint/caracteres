    The <a class="link link--listenable">eł</a> or "L with stroke" is a letter of the Polish alphabet.
  - >
    The modern pronunciation of ł is similar to the /w/ sound in words like
    <a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="en-GB,en">were</a>,
    <a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="en-GB,en">will</a> or
    <a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="en-GB,en">wall</a>.

    This sound originated in the Polish working class in the 16th century, and it was considered an
    uncultured accent by the higher class. Nonetheless, by the mid 20th century the distinction gradually
    began to fade.

    Its original pronunciation was similar to the "ll" sound in the word
    <a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="en-GB,en">pull</a>.
    That pronunciation is still
    understood nowadays, but it is considered theatrical in most regions.
