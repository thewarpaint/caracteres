    The <a class="link link--listenable">eñe</a> (IPA: <span class="ipa">/ˈeɲe/</span>)
    is a letter of the Spanish alphabet.
  - >
    The symbol on top (~) is called tilde, in Spanish also <a class="link link--listenable">virgulilla</a>.
  - >
    It originated as a ligature of "nn", the tilde being a shorthand for a smaller n on top of the
    first one.

    The sound is present in other Romance languages with a different spelling. For example,
    "gn" in Italian (<a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="it-IT,it">gnocchi</a>)
    or French (<a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="fr-FR,fr">mignon</a>),
    "nh" in Portuguese (<a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="pt-PT,pt">amanhã</a>), and
    "ny" in Catalan (<a class="link link--listenable" data-lang="ca">Catalunya</a>).
