description: The Eszett is a letter of the German language.

explanationItems:
  - >
    The <a class="link link--listenable">Eszett</a> (IPA: <span class="ipa">[ɛsˈtsɛt]</span>) is a
    German letter used to represent the [s] phoneme when used after long vowels and diphthongs.
  - >
    Its name comes from the pronunciation of the letters
    S (<a class="link link--listenable">Es</a>) and
    Z (<a class="link link--listenable">Zett</a>).
  - >
    It originated as a ligature for long s and tailed z (<span class="ipa">ſʒ</span>) and
    long s and round s (<span class="ipa">ſs</span>).
  - >
    The uppercase form ẞ introduced by type designers during the early 20th century only gained
    official recognition until 2017. The <a class="link link--listenable">Eszett</a> is still commonly
    replaced with "SS" when capital letters are used.
