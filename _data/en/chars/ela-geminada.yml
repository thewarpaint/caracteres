    The <a class="link link--listenable">ela geminada</a> (geminate L)
    is a "modified character group" of the Catalan language.

    It represents the sound of a double or elongated L, pronounced as two different syllables.
    It is always used between two vowels.

    The flown dot, which appears between the two Ls, was introduced in the early 20th century to
    differentiate between this character group and the "ll" digraph.

    words starting with "al·l", "il·l", and "col·l";
