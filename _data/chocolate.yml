    Although the exact etymology of the word is debated, it comes originally from Náhuatl,
    the language of the Aztec culture.

    Some propose it is derived from <i>xicolatl</i>, "beaten drink".
    Others say it comes from <i>xocóatl</i>, "bitter water".

    What is definitely true is that many languages have adopted the word with small changes
    in its writing and pronunciation.
